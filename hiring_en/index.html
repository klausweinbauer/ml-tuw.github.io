title: We are hiring PhD candidates!
---

Having recently launched the {{site.data.links.TUWienML_en}} research unit, {{site.data.links.TUWienInformatics}} is looking to hire as soon as possible
further machine learning PhD candidates.

<p>
Vienna has repeatedly been named the <a href="https://www.wien.info/en/lifestyle-scene/most-livable-city">most liveable city</a> in the world and the {{site.data.links.InformaticsTUWien}} has consistently been ranked among the top 100 computer science departments in the world. Our group is strongly connected to the European and international machine learning communities. The head of the research unit, {{site.data.people.ThomasGaertner}}, is an editor of the Machine Learning journal, was program co-chair of the largest European conference in the field (ECML PKDD'18), and has been area chair for NeurIPS for a number of years among other <a href="{{'/activities' | prepend: site.data.links.Thomas }}">activities</a>.<br><br>


The {{site.data.links.TUWienMLRU_en}} investigates fundamental machine learning questions and demonstrates the applicability of novel algorithms in real-world applications, often together with colleagues and collaborators from other disciplines such as Chemistry. Challenges that we investigate often involve structured data such as graphs, iterative learning processes such as online/active learning, approximation/convergence guarantees, and computational questions such as the parallelisation of machine learning algorithms. For an overview of some of our research interests, please have a look at previous <a href="t-gaertner.github.io/papers">publications</a>. You may also check out <a href="/people">previous group members</a>.<br><br>

You should have an excellent background in computer science, mathematics, or a related field. We will post the official openings as soon as available. In the meantime, do not hesitate to express your interest or ask any questions by email. Please use <a href="mailto:caml.tuwien+phd@gmail.com?subject=phd position">caml.tuwien+phd ... gmail.com</a>. If expressing your interest, please include <b>one PDF document</b> containing:
<ul>
<li>A cover letter stating the your motivation to apply and the reason(s) why you should be selected for the position;</li>
<li>A curriculum vitae including a list of all publications and transcripts of all marks;</li>
<li>A short research statement (describing possible research questions with motivation, challenges, approach, and pointing out how it connects to the research interests of the group);</li>
<li>The contact details of two referees.</li>
</ul>
Additionally, please also attach a recent demonstration of your scientific abilities (such as a paper, thesis, or report). 
<br>
<b>Full details on how to apply will be published shortly.</b>
