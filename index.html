<h3>Topics</h3>
	Our research aims to narrow the gap between theoretically well-understood and practically relevant machine learning. Research questions concern for instance: 
	<ul>
	<li>learning with non-conventional data, i.e., data that has no inherent representation in a table or Euclidean space</li>
	<li>incorporation of invariances as well as expert domain knowledge in learning algorithms</li>
	<li>computational, sample, query, and communication complexity of learning algorithms</li>
	<li>constructive machine learning scenarios such as structured output prediction</li>
	<li>learning with small labelled data sets and large unlabelled data sets</li>
	<li>adversarial learning with mistake and/or regret bounds</li>
	<li>parallelisation/distribution of learning algorithms</li>
    <li>approximation of learning algorithms</li>
	<li>scalability of learning algorithms</li>
	<li>reliability of learning algorithms</li>
	<li>extreme learning</li>
	<li>...</li>
	</ul>
	To demonstrate the practical effectiveness of novel learning algorithms, we apply them in Chemistry, Material Science, Electrical Engineering, Computer Games, Humanities, etc.
