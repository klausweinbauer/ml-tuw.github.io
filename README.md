# to run locally

- install ruby
```
sudo apt-get install ruby-full build-essential zlib1g-dev
```
- setup ruby by filling your bashrc
```
echo '# Install Ruby Gems to ~/gems' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"' >> ~/.bashrc
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```
- install bundler and jekyll
```gem install bundler```
```gem install jekyll```

- install the local stuff (from this directory)
```bundle install```

- start jekyll server
```bundle exec jekyll serve```

## run as docker container

First, you need to build the docker image. You only need to rebuild the image
when the dependencies change. 

```
docker build -t ml.github.io:latest .
```

When you have the image ready you can start the server with the following
command.

```
docker run -p 4000:4000 -v .:/src ml.github.io:latest
```

# to add a new group member
- Add the group member to `_data/peoplenl.yml`, creating an identifier for them
- Add the identifier and additional information to `_data/group/wien.csv`
- Add the last name to the `grep -e` list of last names in `update_bibliography.sh` 

# to update our list of publications

Our publications are extracted from repositum.tuwien.ac.at. If you want them to appear on our webpage, add them to repositum first and get them accepted ;)

Then, from the main directory, run (locally)
```bash update_bibliography.sh```

### Note!
The script contains a line where we have to manually update all the people which should be *included* in our publication list.
As repositum only resolves to 194-06 level, there are --by default-- more publications visible than from the immediate Thomas GÃ¤rtner RUML group.
So if you are new, check if your (last) name appears in `update_bibliography.sh`
