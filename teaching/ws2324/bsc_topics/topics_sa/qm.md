**Task**: Inferring Markovian quantum master equations of few-body observables in interacting spin chains

**Motivation** Full information about a many-body quantum system is usually out-of-reach due to the exponential growth -- with the size of the system -- of the number of parameters needed to encode its state. Nonetheless, in order to understand the complex phenomenology that can be observed in these systems, it is often sufficient to consider dynamical or stationary properties of local observables or, at most, of few-body correlation functions of a subsystem. One can formulate the problem of finding the generator of the subsystem dynamics as a variational problem, and solve them using the standard toolbox of machine learning for optimization.
