title: ML for SAR image processing
---

**Motivation**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is an active microwave imaging system that provides high-resolution images day and night under all weather conditions. It has been widely used in many practical applications, such as environment, crop monitoring, and disaster detection. Using best-suited machine learning algorithms to derive useful information from these data is essential.

**Overview**:
