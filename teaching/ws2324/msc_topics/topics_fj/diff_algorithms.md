title: Differentiable Algorithms
---

**Motivation:** Classical algorithms cannot be combined with neural networks as training neural networks would require the computation of a gradient which is not possible for classical algorithms. Thus, we are interested in making classical algorithms differentiable.

The above thesis gives an introduction to the field of differentiable algorithms and is built upon many conference publications by the author at strong ML conferences. We recommend picking either one of the chapters or one of the underlying publications from ICML, ICLR, NeurIPS or CVPR as a basis.
