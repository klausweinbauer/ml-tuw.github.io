**Task**: Participate in multiple Kaggle competitions and try different learning approaches. Note: if the deadline is too close, you may not be able to submit to the competition, but you can still keep working on the project for this course.

**Suggested approach**:
Tackle 1-3 Kaggle challenges (depending on the scope of the challenges). We recommend taking at least one of the "ongoing challenges". Additionally, tackle at least one from the "suggested further challenges" with at least two different approaches. Preferably, at least one of your challenges deals with non-tabular data, such as text, time series, graphs, and so on.
