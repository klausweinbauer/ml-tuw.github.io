title: RecSys Challenge 2022

**Question**: When given user sessions, purchase data and content data about items, can you accurately predict which fashion item will be bought at the end of the session?

**Suggested approach**: Participate in the [RecSys Challenge 2022](http://www.recsyschallenge.com/2022/).

**Related work**: [Past winners](https://recsys.acm.org/challenges/) for the RecSys Challenge.

**Context**: In the fashion domain items churn at a very high rate and using content data is essential. In this challenge a portion of the test purchases we evaluate against will be newer items that have little or no past interaction data. However, these candidate items will have label data and can be recommended successfully if we can identify which labels a user session has a preference for. This is an accurate reflection of what happens in the real world, where items are available to us to preview and apply content data before they go live, but when they go live we have to be able to recommend them accurately straight away. 

**Dataset and start date**: Sign up and [access the dataset](https://www.dressipi-recsys2022.com/), starting 7 March, 2022.
