title: Beyond Worst-Case Analysis of Data Science Algorithms
---

**Motivation**: 

Data science algorithms are successfully utilized in many different areas on a daily basis. Typically, these algorithms solve problems that are NP-hard and often even hard to approximate. Understanding why these algorithms work so well in practice is an important question in the area of beyond worst-case analysis.

**Overview**: 

The book “Beyond the Worst-Case Analysis of Algorithms” by Tim Roughgarden provides a good starting point for literature search. We are particularly interested in the results related to Chapters 6, 7, 20, 28 and 30 of this book. It is encouraged to also look at other chapters of this book and papers related to these chapters.

**Supervisor**: Prof. Dr. Stefan Neumann
