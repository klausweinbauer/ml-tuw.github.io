PAC provides a mathematical foundation for ensuring that learned policies are close to optimal, instilling confidence in the reliability of RL algorithms. With PAC, RL agents can make decisions in critical healthcare scenarios with a high degree of certainty, mitigating risks associated with uncertain outcomes.
