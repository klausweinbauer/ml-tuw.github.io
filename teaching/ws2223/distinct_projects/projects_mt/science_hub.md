title: Entity classification in crypto ecosystems
---

This is an interdisciplinary project jointly with the Complexity Science Hub Vienna

**Question**:
How can we use graph representation learning for entity classification in crypto ecosystems?

**Suggested Approach**:
The goal of this project should be to classify entities in the Ethereum relationships between Ethereum addresses, which can be represented in a multigraph. The paper of Weber [1] should be the guildine and reference point how the project could look like.
