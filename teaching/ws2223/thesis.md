Thank you for your interest in writing your thesis with our group!

Firstly, we need to identify a research topic and then narrow it down to a small **research question in the machine learning area**.

You can have a look at our [Machine Learning Algorithms and Applications](./ana6ects.html) projects in our teaching page to get some inspiration. If you are interested in a topic (or you want to propose your own) please reach out to us!


In particualr, we expect from you a short research proposal from you (~3 pages) describing
 - **what** the learning problem is,
 - **why** solving this problem is important, and
 - **how** you will approach the topic

as well as briefly outlining related work, involved challenges, and an estimated timeline for the work. We will then review and discuss the proposal, and decide how to proceed.
