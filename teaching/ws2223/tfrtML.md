title: Theoretical Foundations and Research Topics in Machine Learning
---

Welcome to the lecture on **Theoretical Foundations and Research Topics in Machine Learning**. A new lecture unit will be available about once a week and consists of recordings (_We don't aim at fixing every small error from the recordings as those would also happen in live lectures_), lecture notes, videos, and/or notebooks for you to study.  You may ask questions at any time in our TUWEL forum and we will hold live (potentially hybrid) discussion sessions whenever the need is clear. Additionally, there will be coursework for you to submit, for instance, tackling a learning problem with advanced machine learning methods or understanding and explaining a proof. The live sessions will be announced well in advance.
**Any feedback and constructive criticism is very welcome.** 

**The course will be held on TUWEL.**
