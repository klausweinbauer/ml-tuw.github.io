title: Topological Deep Learning for social network datasets
---

**Type**: Implementing topology informed GNN with Pythorch (Geometric)

**Question**:
Can we leverage information arising from higher-order interaction for social networks predicion tasks?

**Suggested Approach**:
The concept of filtration (of a set) has been employed in the context of graph learning to enrich message passing with topological information arising from higher order interactions in various ways. In this project, we aim to combine (and eventually extend) existing approaches and evaluate their effectiveness on prediction tasks over social network datasets.
