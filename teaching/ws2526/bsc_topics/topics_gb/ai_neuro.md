title: AI and Neuroscience
---

**Motivation:** 
We aim to understand computation in the brain. Our research either uses recent Deep learning technology to analyze brain recordings (AI for neuroscience), or we derived comptutation principles from the neuron to inspire future generation of AI algorithms (brain inspired computing).

**Expected outcomes**:
- AI for neuroscience 1: Training a deep neural network to extract neuron activation times from electrode array recordings  
- AI for neuroscience 2: Compression of electrode array recordings via deep signal tokenization  
- Brain inspired computing 1: Theoretical derivation of simplified brain-like computing models  
- Brain inspired computing 2: Performance of LLM with a specific bio-inspired feature
