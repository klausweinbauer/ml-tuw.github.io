title: Graph Neural Differential Equations
---

**Motivation**:
The family of Graph Neural Differential Equations (GNDEs) extends GNNs to the continuous regime. GNDEs are generally expected to be better at capturing long-range dependencies and fine-grained dynamics in comparison to message-passing GNNs.
