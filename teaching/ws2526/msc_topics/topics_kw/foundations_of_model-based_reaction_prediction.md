title: Foundations of Model-Based Reaction Prediction
---


**Motivation**: Machine learning has become a cornerstone of automated synthesis planning in organic chemistry.
A key step in this process is reaction prediction.
Over the past 15 years, numerous models and architectures (template-based, GNNs, transformers, ...) have been developed to address this complex task.
Yet, reaction prediction can refer to a range of distinct modeling tasksâ€”such as predicting products, assessing feasibility, or classifying mechanisms.
Comparing existing models is often non-trivial, as their assumptions and objectives vary and the boundaries between prediction tasks are often unclear.
For instance, a model trained for product prediction may also be applied to assess reaction feasibility.
This motivates the exploration of a formal framework that clarifies the relationships between different modeling approaches.
