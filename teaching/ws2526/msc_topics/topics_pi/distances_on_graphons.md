title: Distances and Geometry of Graphons
---

**Motivation**  
Graphons serve as limit objects for large graphs, providing a geometric view of networks. Distances between graphons let us formalize graph convergence, quantify similarity, and study stability of statistics and algorithms. Understanding these metrics is key for estimation, privacy, and learning on graphs.
