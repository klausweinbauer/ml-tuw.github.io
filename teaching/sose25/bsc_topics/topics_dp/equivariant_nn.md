title: Equivariant neural networks
---

**Motivation**: Many datastructures have an innate structure that our neural networks should respect. For example the output of a graph neural networks should not change if we permute the vertices (permutation equivariance/invariance).

**Overview**:

- chapter 8 "equivariant neural networks" of "Deep learning for molecules and materials" by Andrew D. White, 2021. [(pdf)](https://whitead.github.io/dmol-book/dl/Equivariant.html).
- introduction to equivariance: Taco Cohen and Risi Kondor - Neurips 2020 Tutorial (first half) [(slideslive-link)](https://slideslive.com/38943570/equivariant-networks)

**Papers and topics**:

- neural network that can learn on sets (Zaheer, et al. "Deep sets." NeurIPS 2017)
- learning equivariance from data (Zhou, et al. "Meta-learning symmetries by reparameterization." ICLR 2021)
