title: Exploring the New Generation of Streaming Algorithms
---

**Motivation**: The data streaming model deals with processing large data sets that arrive continuously over time, where storing all data is impractical. Algorithms in this model make decisions using limited memory, typically by summarizing or sampling data on-the-fly, making it ideal for real-time applications such as network traffic analysis or sensor data processing.

**Overview**:

In the context of big data and real-time processing, it is essential to efficiently compute statistics on data streams. One important problem is estimating the number of distinct elements in a data stream, known as the **Distinct Elements Problem**. This problem has applications in fields such as network traffic monitoring, database management, and large-scale data analysis.
This project aims to explore recent contributions in this area and their applications in various real-world scenarios.
The goal of this project is to understand and explore space-efficient algorithms for dealing with streaming data, focusing on recent advancements, particularly the contributions of **Sourav Chakraborty**, **Kuldeep Meel**, and **N.V. Vinodchandran**.
