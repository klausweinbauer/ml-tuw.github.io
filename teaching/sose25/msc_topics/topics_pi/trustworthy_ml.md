title: Trustworthy ML
---

**Motivation**: Machine learning systems are ubiquitous and it is necessary to make sure they behave as intended. In particular, trustworthiness can be achieved by means of privacy-preserving, robust, and explainable algorithms. We focus here on the desideratum of privacy.
