title: Predictive maintenance for car chassis components
---

This is an interdisciplinary project with [CARIAD](https://cariad.technology/), an automotive software company which is part of the Volkswagen Group.

**Question**: To which extent is it possible to perform predictive maintenance using vehicle component data and prior knowledge?

**Suggested Approach**: Performing literature review on predictive maintenance and comparing different modelling approaches.

**Related Work**:
- Rune Prytza, Sławomir Nowaczyk, Thorsteinn Rögnvaldsson and Stefan Byttner. Predicting the need for vehicle compressor repairs using maintenance records and logged vehicle data. Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence 2015.

**Context**:
Predictive maintenance is a proactive strategy to determine the performance of an asset (e.g., a specific component in a truck) and predict when maintenance is needed before breakdowns. The dataset consists of data collected from heavy Scania trucks in everyday usage. The system in focus is the Air Pressure system (APS) which generates pressurised air that is utilised in various functions in a truck, such as breaking and gear changes. 
The data consists of a subset of all available data, selected by experts. The positive class consists of component failures for a specific component of the APS system. The negative class consists of trucks with failures for components not related to the APS.
