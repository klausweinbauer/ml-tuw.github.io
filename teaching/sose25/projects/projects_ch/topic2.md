title: Safety-Critical Applications of Reinforcement Learning
---

**Type**: Safety-critical applications of reinforcement learning (multiple topics)

**Recommended skills**: Course on reinforcement learning.  Strong programming skills (Python and/or Julia) for applications.

**Task**: Implement and test modern RL algorithms and devise new algorithms.

**Context**: In safety critical applications, distributional RL makes it possible to quantify risk.  In real-world applications, deep RL makes it possible to treat large state spaces.  We have experience in medical applications and want to learn more optimal strategies on recent datasets.

**Suggested approach**: Distributional RL, deep RL.
