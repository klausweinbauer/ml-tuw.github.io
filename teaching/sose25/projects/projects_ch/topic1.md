title: Theory of Reinforcement Learning
---

**Type**: Theory of reinforcement learning (multiple topics)

**Recommended skills**: Course on reinforcement learning.  Strong mathematical/theoretical background.

**Task**: Show convergence results for algorithms in RL.  Show lower bounds on the performance of RL algorithms, i.e. PAC (probably approximately correct) estimates.  Based on the PAC estimates, show computational complexity.

**Context**: In safety critical applications, convergence results and performance estimates are of utmost importance for reliable/safe/robust learning.

**Suggested approach**: Use fixed-point arguments and concentration inequalities.
