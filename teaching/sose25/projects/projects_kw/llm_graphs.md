title: Graph Data Mining from Text with LLMs 

---


Through the emergence of powerful LLMs we have now a utility that allows
for automated reading and understanding of a large text corpus. We want
to investigate how we can utilize LLMs to extract graph data with
context from suitable text sources. We could ask, for example, under
which conditions can an LLM extract correct graph representations and
what is a suitable grammar for the output. A possible area of
application is the extraction of chemical reaction counter-examples,
commonly modeled as labeled graphs, from scientific literature. Data on
chemical reactions that can not happen in practice is almost
nonexistent, however, these types of reactions are well documented in
scientific literature.\
