title: Deep Learning in Cataract Surgery
---

__Type:__
Develop and validate a deep learning model.

__Recommended Skills:__
Experience with machine learning using Python. Ideally: experience with implementing and training neural networks with a deep learning framework (like PyTorch).

__Task:__
Develop and validate a deep learning model to automatically segment intraocular lens (IOL) axis in toric IOLs.

__Context:__
In cataract surgery, patients with higher astigmatism require toric IOL implantation for improvement in vision-related quality of life (spectacle independence). Rotational stability of the IOL is crucial. Thus, we want to develop a deep learning model to automatically detect IOL rotation based on clinically recorded images, to validate safety and efficacy of new toric IOLs.

__Suggested approach:__
Implement a deep learning model and evaluate its performance with the standardized and well-tried method of Schartmüller et al.. The work will be conducted in adherence to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki and a positive ethics approval.
