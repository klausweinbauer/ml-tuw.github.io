title: Prof. Thomas Gärtner's Project List
---

Below is a list of a few topics I am happy to supervise. Most of the topics can scale 
from an algorithms and applications project all the way to a thesis. Smaller projects can 
focus on a few aspects while theses should leave out only few. Once you've chosen a topic, it is very important to narrow down the rough topic to a tentative research question and approach of interest to both of us. The research question should not have been answered previously and should involve machine learning algorithms and/or theory. To 
answer the question, typically one has to implement an algorithm and apply it to some 
dataset. I am happy to supervise other topics as well if you are able to describe the scientific merrit and novelty of the machine learning algorithm/theory sufficiently well.


## Scalable Interactive Analysis

**Question**: How can constraints be incorporated into meaningful low-dimensional embeddings of data?

**Approach**: PCA, power method.

## Analysis of (Bacteriophage)Cocktails

**Question**: How can we find the most effective (Bacteriophage)Cocktail?

**Approach**: Learning with structured data, structured output prediction, constructive machine learning.

## Robust Machine Learning

**Question**: How can we find robust hypotheses that attackers can not easily manipulate?

**Approach**: Tukey center, Radon points.

## Cross-target Learning

**Question**: How can we use data from related tasks for effective learning? (across multiple biological targets and/or across languages)

**Approach**: Embedding them in the same space.
