title: Teaching in ML - Designing a Massive Open Online Course
---

**Type**:  Implementation of exercises and projects for students in Python (Jupyter Notebook)

**Recommended Skills**: Knowledge of basic ML algorithms such as Regression, Decision Trees, SVM, Clustering algorithms, programming with Python

**Task**:  Support our project team designing a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) for Bachelor students which introduces ML. Part of this project is to design and implement exercises and projects as well as methods to evaluate them automatically.

**Context**: In collaboration with JKU Linz, our ML team is tasked to design a MOOC for introducing the concepts of AI and ML to Bachelor students. As this project involves many different tasks, we are looking for students to support us with the above described task.

**Suggested approach**: Description of individual tasks and implementation using Jupyter Notebooks, designing a (guided) code skeleton in Jupyter Notebooks for implementing different types of algorithms for the projects. An interesting direction for the automatic evaluation of projects might also be to train a model that evaluates the quality and correctness of Python code for ML projects.
