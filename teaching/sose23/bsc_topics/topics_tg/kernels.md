title: Kernels
---

**Motivation**: Kernels generalise linear classifiers to linear functions in a (potentially infinite dimensional) feature space. They are the foundation of various popular machine learning algorithms like the kernel SVM and kernel PCA.

**Overview**:

- preface and introduction up to section 1.5 of "Learning with kernels" by Bernhard Schölkopf and Alex Smola, 2002 [(pdf)](http://agbs.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de/lwk/).
- introduction to kernels: Bernhard Schölkopf - MLSS 2013 [(youtube-link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzWgB1VO9xQ)
