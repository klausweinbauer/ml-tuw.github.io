title: Semi-supervised learning
---

**Motivation**: Semi-supervised learning uses labelled and to be able to train classifiers with fewer labels. This is useful in applications where unlabelled data is abundant, yet labels are scarce, such as node classification in social networks, drug discovery, and autonomous driving.

**Overview**:

- chapter 1/introduction of "Semi-supervised learning" by Olivier Chapelle, Bernhard Sch√∂lkopf, and Alexander Zien, 2006 [(pdf)](http://olivier.chapelle.cc/ssl-book/ssl_toc.pdf).
- introduction to semi-supervised learning: Tom Mitchell - Carnegie Mellon University 2011 [(youtube-link)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMRlnKupsXM)

**Papers and topics**:

- transductive support vector machines (chapter 6 in the "Semi-supervised learning" book mentioned above)
- label propagation (chapter 11 in the "Semi-supervised learning" book mentioned above)
- randomized min-cuts (Blum, Avrim, et al., "Semi-supervised learning using randomized mincuts.", ICML 2004)
