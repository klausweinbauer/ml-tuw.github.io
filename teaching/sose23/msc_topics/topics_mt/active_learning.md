title: Active Learning
---

**Motivation**: In active learning, the learning algorithm is allowed to select the data points it wants to see labelled, for example, where it is most uncertain. The goal is to reduce the labelling effort. This is useful in applications where unlabelled data is abundant, yet labels are scarce, such as node classification in social networks, drug discovery, and autonomous driving.

**Overview**:
