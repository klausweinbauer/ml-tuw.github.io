title: Submodularity in ML
---

**Motivation**: Submodularity is a property of set functions similar to convexity for real-valued functions. It allows to build strong machine learning algorithms for sub-task such as sketching, coresets, data distillation, and data subset selection. Moreover, it is useful for clustering, active and semi-supervised learning.

**Overview**:

- chapter 1-3 of "Learning with submodular functions: a convex optimization perspective" by Francis Bach, 2013.
